   - Open your browser
   - Go to: **https://nodejs.org/**
   - Click the **green button** that says "LTS" (Long Term Support)

2. **Install Node.js**
   - Find the downloaded file (usually in Downloads folder)
   - Double-click to run the installer

3. **Verify Installation**
   - **IMPORTANT:** Close VS Code completely
   - Reopen VS Code
   - Open a new terminal (Terminal → New Terminal)

## 💡 Why Node.js is Required

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Node.js** | JavaScript runtime (runs your code) |
| **npm** | Package manager (installs libraries) |
| **Vite** | Development server (runs your website) |
| **React** | UI framework (builds your website) |

Think of it like this:
- **Node.js** = The engine
- **npm** = The parts supplier
- **Vite** = The workshop
- **React** = The blueprint

You need the engine first! 🚗

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "I installed Node.js but it still says 'not recognized'"

**Solution:**
1. Close VS Code **completely** (not just the window, quit the app)
2. Reopen VS Code
3. Open a **new** terminal
4. Try again

**Why:** Windows needs to refresh its environment variables.

### "Which version of Node.js should I download?"

**Answer:** Get the **LTS (Long Term Support)** version - it's the green button on nodejs.org. Currently v20.x or v22.x.

### "Do I need to pay for Node.js?"

**Answer:** No! Node.js is 100% free and open-source.

### "Will this affect other programs on my computer?"

**Answer:** No! Node.js installs cleanly and doesn't interfere with other software.
